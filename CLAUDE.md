## Extensions

All extensions in `extensions/`. Load with `pi -e extensions/<name>.ts` or via `justfile`.

Active (used in daily workflow):
- `agent-chain.ts` — sequential pipeline orchestrator (`pi-chain`)
- `agent-team.ts` — Luffy dispatcher (`pi-crew`)
- `project-context.ts` — injects CLAUDE.md + stack into agents
- `theme-cycler.ts` — Ctrl+X/Q theme switching

Available for ad-hoc use (via `justfile`):
- `damage-control.ts`, `tilldone.ts`, `subagent-widget.ts`, `scheduler.ts`
- `session-replay.ts`, `pi-pi.ts`, `pi-setup.ts`, `agent-builder.ts`
- `minimal.ts`, `tool-counter.ts`, `system-select.ts`, and others

## Type checking

```bash
cd ~/code/pi-builder
bunx tsc 2>&1 | grep "error TS"   # should show only project-context.ts pre-existing error
```

---

## SOP: Slash command autocomplete

Every user-facing feature MUST register a slash command via `pi.registerCommand()`.
See the command registry table in STACK.md.

---

## Simplicity principle

Fixes that use `// @ts-ignore` or cast to `any` → discard.
A correct 1-line fix > a workaround 10-line fix.
